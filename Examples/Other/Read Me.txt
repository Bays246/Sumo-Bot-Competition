Creating a Song by Rhyan McLaughlin

1. Pick a Song
	-It must be realtively simple, think beginner level piano sheet music
	-The buzzer is a 2 tone buzzer so options in scale can be somewhat limited as well

2. Translating the Song
	-If you are unfamiliar with basic music notes and beats you may want to pull up a guide
	-If the music isn't on beat / properly spaced the notes will play fast
	-Terminology:
		# - is a Sharp
		- - is a Flat
		< - makes the following not play higher on the scale
		> - makes the following note play lower on the scale
		abcdefg - basic music notes
		R - is a rest
		X8 - A letter followed imdeatily by a number is how long that note is played 4/8/16.....ect
		O# - Sets the Octave I tend to use O4
		T# - sets the temp (Example: T120)
		L4 - Set all notes to a default beat (Example: L8, defualt is 4)
		V# - Increases the volume
		MS - Plays following note in staccato (Example: MSc)
		ML - Plays following note in Legato (Example: MLc)

	-View the attached picture of song, it roughly translates to
		- "O4 c c g g a a g8 f f e e d d c8"

3. Put the song in the code as an array
	const char song_name[] PROGMEM = "O4 c c g g a a g8 f f e e d d c8";

4.Play it
	Put buzzer.playFromProgramSpace(song_name); in a loop and upload it


Also this webpage can be hard to get to but better lists the above info: https://pololu.github.io/a-star-32u4-arduino-library/class_pololu_buzzer.html
It also has other things to help make the Zumo work
